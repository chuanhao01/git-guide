# Git Guide

An introduction to the Git version control system.

## Objectives

This guide aims to provide developers with a broad understanding of the Git version control system and a common Git workflow. It does not go into depth with a wide variety of more complex Git commands. Those can be picked up once you have developed an intuition for Git.

Git is a vast topic and it will be impossible to cover the entirity of the Git tooling in a single session. Additional resources have been added below for your reference. You are encouraged to explore beyond what is taught to better understand the tool.
