# Chapter 1 - Setup

To setup this project, you will first have installed Git on your machine. The instructions to do so can be found [here.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Once you have installed Git, open up your terminal or Git Bash (if you are on Windows) and type the following command to verify that Git has been installed. You should see that an appropriate number will be shown.

```bash
$ git --version
```

You will also be using GitHub to manage your projects. More details will be explained about this in the following chapters. To get started with GitHub, create a new account [here.](https://github.com/) GitHub recently made private repositories with teams free.

This is all you will need to setup your environment. Hooray!
